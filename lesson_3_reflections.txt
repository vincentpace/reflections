When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When sharing with others
    When in need of a safe back-up

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    So you know what changes were made
    So you can make sure you want those changes pulled

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

    Branches: Two varying versions in a single repo
    Clones: Same version in two places (two local places or one local and one remote)
    Forks: Two clones on GitHub

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Working offline

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier, and what would be harder?

    Saving versions manually
    Harder: Comparing, collaborating
    Easier: Initial set-up

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When experimenting
    When doing something that might break the code
